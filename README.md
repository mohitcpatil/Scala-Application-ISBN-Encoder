# Scala Application ISBN Encoder

This Application covers [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/programming-guide.html), [Dataframes](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) and Scala/Java.

### Tasks

The goals of the tasks are to pass all tests and implement it in a way that it performs very well for big data. The steps in detail:

1. Fork the project and create a new branch for your implementation
2. Implement the function, according to documentation and tests
3. Build the module and pass all tests
4. Update the chapter "Describe your solution" in the README files
5. Create a pull request

### Comment

It can also be implemented with Java by replacing the [Implicit Class](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html) with an instance of your Java class.
